    <h2> Slice of Happiness</h2>
    <p>Nothing beats a fresh-out-of-the-oven pizza, and once you see how easy it is to make for yourself, you'll never order delivery again. <br>
    First things first, make your dough.Then, get topping. <br>
    Thats the key!
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
   
        <h3> For The Dough</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Cooking spray</li>
            <li> 1 1/4 cup lukewarm water</li>
            <li>1 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li> active dry yeast (2 1/4 tsp.)</li>
            <li> 3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> salt</li>
            <li> olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> For The Pizza</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup cornmeal, divided</li>
            <li> 1 c. marinara, divided</li>
            <li> fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced, divided</li>
            <li> fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li> pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Grease a large bowl with cooking spray. <br>
            In a small bowl add water and sugar and stir to dissolve, then sprinkle over yeast and let sit until frothy, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>In another large bowl, add flour, salt, and oil. Pour in yeast mixture, then mix with a wooden spoon until everything is combined and a shaggy dough begins to form. <br>
                 Knead against sides of bowl until dough starts to come together, then turn onto your work surface and knead, adding a pinch of flour if needed, until it feels elastic and only slightly tacky, 5 minutes. <br>
                  Form into a tight ball, place into prepared bowl, and cover with a clean dish towel. Let rise in a warm spot in your kitchen until doubled in size, about 1 hour and 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Gently punch down dough, then divide in 2, and roll into balls. <br>
                 At this point, you can freeze one, or make two pizzas. Let dough balls rest as you preheat oven to 500° and grease a large baking sheet with olive oil. <br>
                  Sprinkle all over with 2 tablespoons cornmeal. 
            </li>
            
            <li>On your work surface, gently flatten one ball of dough and roll with a rolling pin (or stretch with your hands) until about 12” in diameter (as thin as you can). <br>
                Carefully transfer to prepared baking sheet and brush dough all over with oil. <br>
                 Then, add your 1/2 cup sauce to middle of dough and spread outwards with a spoon or ladle, leaving about 1” for the crust. <br>
                 Top with half the slices of mozzarella. Bake until crust is golden and cheese is melty, about 15 minutes. </li>
                
            <li>
                Top with fresh basil leaves, a drizzle of olive oil, and red pepper flakes. 
            </li>
            <li> Repeat with remaining dough and toppings for second pizza.</li>
            
        </ol>
